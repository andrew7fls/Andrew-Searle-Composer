									<p>Reaching the Water's Edge is my debut album and has been in the making for over two years. The music on the album represents an exploration of my adult life. The album hopes to tell a story from this exploration and to act as a way of processing this period of my life. More information regarding the meaning behind each track on the album can be found below (The full tracklist will be updated on release of the album). </p>
									<p>The album will be available at most music streaming and purchasing sites on 28th August 2021. Click <a href="https://linktr.ee/andrewsearlecomposer"target="_blank">here</a> for links to listen on your streaming service of choice.</p>

										<h2>Reaching the Water's Edge</h2>
										
										
										‘Reaching the Water’s Edge‘ is about a time in my life where I hit a wall and couldn’t see any way around it. When emotions build to a climax that need to be released in some way. The recurring synth motif intentionally provides a slightly uncomfortable experience to represent this as the track builds. This was the first piece written for this album and laid the foundations for the story that I wanted to tell through the music. 
									</p>
									<p>
										<h2>Finding Hope</h2>
										
										
										As a child, most of us are fortunate enough to experience the world on a day-by-day basis, meaning that each day is a fresh start full of new opportunities. As we venture into adulthood, feelings become more permanent and perhaps more entrenched. Allowing ourselves to explore again and reconnect with the important things in our lives can provide hope for the future and allow us to see each day with fresh optimism. ‘Finding hope’ was a lot of fun to write as it was all about me experimenting and ‘playing’ with the music.
