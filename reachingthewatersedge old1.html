									<span class="image main"><img src="images/rtwecoverfrontback.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Reaching the Water's Edge is my debut album and has been in the making for over two years. The music on the album represents an exploration of my adult life. The album hopes to tell a story from this exploration and to act as a way of processing this period of my life. More information regarding the meaning behind each track on the album can be found below. </p>
									<p>The album is available at most music streaming and purchasing sites following it's release on the 28th August 2021. Click <a href="https://linktr.ee/andrewsearlecomposer"target="_blank">here</a> for links to listen on your streaming service of choice.</p>

									<h1>
										Tracklist 
									</h1>

									<p>
										<h2>1. Floating</h2>
										Floating starts off the album by setting a sombre tone. A tone that reflects the reality of living a life where you do the same work each day, see the same sights and hear the same sounds. Only for it all to be repeated the following day. I feel incredibly blessed to now live a life where I can be creative and passionate about the life I lead,  but also strongly remember the times when this wasn’t the case.  
									</p>
									<p>
										<h2>2. Deep</h2>
										Deep is about the sense of scale of the world around us and the greater discovery of our world that we can experience as we progress through our lives. It can be terrifying to contemplate the tiny impact that we have. But it can also be awe inspiring and beautiful to venture out and leave our mark on the world and more importantly the people around us.
									</p>
									<p>
										<h2>3. Finding Hope</h2>
										
										
										As a child, most of us are fortunate enough to experience the world on a day-by-day basis, meaning that each day is a fresh start full of new opportunities. As we venture into adulthood, feelings become more permanent and perhaps more entrenched. Allowing ourselves to explore again and reconnect with the important things in our lives can provide hope for the future and allow us to see each day with fresh optimism. ‘Finding hope’ was a lot of fun to write as it was all about me experimenting and ‘playing’ with the music.  
									</p>
									<p>
										<h2>4. Drowning</h2>
										‘Drowning’ is a very raw piece and was written during an equally sensitive time. It is quite unpleasant to listen to (and a touch experimental in nature!) and was very close to not making it onto the album. However, it does evoke the sense of distress that covers this section of our ‘journey’ well and leads us towards the title track of Reaching the Water’s Edge.
									</p>
									<p>
										<h2>5. Reaching the Water's Edge</h2>
										
										
										‘Reaching the Water’s Edge‘ is about a time in my life where I hit a wall and couldn’t see any way around it. When emotions build to a climax that need to be released in some way. The recurring synth motif intentionally provides a slightly uncomfortable experience to represent this as the track builds. This was the first piece written for this album and laid the foundations for the story that I wanted to tell through the music. 
									</p>

									<p>
										<h2>6. Momentum</h2>
										Being at the mercy of a force that has complete power over you is a thrill that some people seek at theme parks. But when it happens in an uncontrolled place like the sea, you just hope that at some point the storm will pass and you will be gently placed back onto a sandy beach. 
										
										  
									</p>
									<p>
										<h2>7. A drop of Peace</h2>
										For whatever reason, sometimes, the world around us stops and gives us the respite to breath. ‘A drop of peace’ is exactly that experience. These moments are so few and far between that when they come, we need to use them as an opportunity for change and progression. Knowing the person that you are when everything else in the world is stripped away leaves you nowhere to hide and forces you to challenge yourself. It is the turning point in the album.
									</p>
									<p>
										<h2>8. In the Silence</h2>
										Since the start of the pandemic, we have been forced to spend a lot of time isolated and with our own thoughts. In the silence is about the battle to stay positive and creative despite these restrictions and to use them as a constructive opportunity to re-shape yourself into the person you want to be.
									</p>
									<p>
										<h2>9. Áin frá Himnaríki </h2>
										At some point in a journey of grief, you begin to establish a new relationship with that lost person and rebuild a connection to wherever you believe they are. It may only exist in your head, but it can feel as real as you allow it to be.
									</p>
									<p>
										<h2>10. If I could have just one conversation </h2>
										‘If I could have just one more conversation’ is my attempt to answer the question: If you could speak to that person who is missing from your life, what would you say? This could be a long lost friend, a friend or relative who has died, or even a relationship which has changed and become unrecognisable. 
									</p>
									<p>
										<h2>11. Swimming with her </h2>
										This piece reflects on the feeling of being in a moment with someone where nothing else matters except that individual and the place you are. The sounds and sights around you blur away into obscurity and time stands softly still. This was the final piece to be written for the album marks the start of the next chapter. 
									</p>

										<h2>12. Future </h2>
