									<p>Reaching the Water's Edge is my debut album and has been in the making for over two years and has been a dream come true to be able to finish and release it.The music on the album represents an exploration of my adult life. More information regarding the meaning behind each track on the album can be found below. </p>
									<p>The musical styles shift quite a bit throughout the album as this was all about providing me with an outlet to express what I was feeling in whichever style I felt fitted. Some of it is therefore quite experimental! I strongly believe that music is primarily about the sounds and where those sounds take you in your own imagination. </p>
									<p>The album is available at most music streaming and purchasing sites now! Click <a href="https://linktr.ee/andrewsearlecomposer"target="_blank">here</a> for links to listen on your streaming service of choice.</p>

									<h1>
										Tracklist 
									</h1>

									<p>
										<h2>1. Floating</h2>
										‘Floating’ kicks off the album, setting a sombre tone, reflecting the reality of living a life where you do the same work each day, see the same sights and hear the same sounds, only for it all to be repeated the following day. I feel incredibly blessed to now live a life where I can be creative and passionate about the life I lead, but also vividly remember the times when this wasn’t the case.  
									</p>
									<p>
										<h2>2. Deep</h2>
										‘Deep’ is about the sense of scale of the world around us and the greater discovery of our world that we can experience as we progress through our lives. It can be terrifying to contemplate the tiny impact that we have, but it can also be awe inspiring and beautiful to venture out and leave our mark on the world and more importantly the people around us.
									</p>
									<p>
										<h2>3. Finding Hope</h2>
										
										
										As a child, most of us are fortunate enough to experience the world on a day-by-day basis, meaning that each day is a fresh start full of new opportunities. As we venture into adulthood, feelings become more permanent and perhaps more entrenched. Allowing ourselves to explore and reconnect with the important aspects of our lives can provide hope for the future and allow us to approach each day with fresh optimism. ‘Finding hope’ was a lot of fun to write as it was all about experimenting and ‘playing’ with the music.  
									</p>
									<p>
										<h2>4. Drowning</h2>
										‘Drowning’ is an incredibly raw piece and was written during an equally sensitive time. It is quite uncomfortable to listen to (and a touch experimental in nature!) and was very close to not making it onto the album. However, it effectively evokes the sense of distress that covers this section of our ‘story’ and leads us towards the title track of ‘Reaching the Water’s Edge.’
									</p>
									<p>
										<h2>5. Reaching the Water's Edge</h2>
										
										
										‘Reaching the Water’s Edge‘ is about a time in my life when I hit a wall and couldn’t see any way through it; when emotions built to a climax that needed to be released in some way. The recurring synth motif intentionally provides a slightly uncomfortable experience as the track builds, representing this immovable emotional situation. This was the first piece written for this album and laid the foundations for the story that I wanted to share through the music. 
									</p>

									<p>
										<h2>6. Momentum</h2>
										Being at the mercy of a force that has complete power over you is a thrill that some people seek out at theme parks. However, when it happens in an uncontrolled environment, like the sea, you can only hope that the storm will pass and you will be gently returned to a sandy beach. 
										
										  
									</p>
									<p>
										<h2>7. A drop of Peace</h2>
										For whatever reason, the world around us sometimes stops and gives us the respite to breath. ‘A drop of peace’ represents that precise experience. These moments are so few and far between that, when they come, we need to use them as an opportunity for change and progression. Knowing the person that you are, when everything else in the world is stripped away, leaves you nowhere to hide and forces you to challenge yourself. This is the turning point of the album.
									</p>
									<p>
										<h2>8. In the Silence</h2>
										Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have been forced to spend a lot of time isolated and with our own thoughts. ‘In the silence’ is about the battle to remain positive and creative despite these restrictions and to use them as a constructive opportunity to re-shape yourself into the person you want to be.
									</p>
									<p>
										<h2>9. Áin frá Himnaríki </h2>
										At some point during a journey of grief, you begin to establish a new relationship with that lost person and forge a connection to wherever you believe they are. It may only exist in your mind, but it can feel as real as you allow it to be.
									</p>
									<p>
										<h2>10. If I could have just one conversation </h2>
										‘If I could have just one more conversation’ is my attempt to answer the question: “If you could speak to that person who is missing from your life, what would you say?” This could be a long lost friend, a friend or relative who has died, or even a relationship which has changed and become unrecognisable. 
									</p>
									<p>
										<h2>11. Swimming with her </h2>
										This piece reflects on the feeling of being in a moment with someone where nothing else matters except that individual and the location. The sounds and sights around you blur away into obscurity and time stands still. This, the final piece to be written for the album, marks the start of the next chapter. 
									</p>
									<p>
										<h2>12. Future </h2>
										‘Future’ is about potential possibilities and the excitement that comes from knowing that you are unable to control or predict what will happen. It’s vital to embrace that knowledge to make sure you take advantage of the parts of your life that you are in control of and make them positive.
